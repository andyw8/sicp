“Observe that our model of evaluation allows for combinations whose operators
are compound expressions. Use this observation to describe the behavior of the
following procedure:

(define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
  ((if (> b 0) + -) a b))
”

If `b` is positive, this is effectively:

(define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
  (+ a b))

If `b` is negative, this is effectively:

(define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
  (- a b))

Which is mathematically equivalent to:

(define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
  (+ a -b))

i.e. `b` is negated, then `a` and `b` are summed.
